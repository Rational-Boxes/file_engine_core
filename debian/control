Description: A distributed virtual filesystem with horizontal scaling and hybrid cloud/on-premises deployment support
 FileEngine Core is a simplified, focused implementation of a distributed
 virtual filesystem with horizontal scaling and hybrid cloud/on-premises
 deployment support. It provides features like:
 .
 * UUID-based file identification for distributed handling
 * Automatic versioning with microsecond precision timestamps
 * POSIX-compliant ACLs for granular access control
 * Intelligent file culling with configurable thresholds
 * Hybrid cloud/on-premises deployment support
 * S3/MinIO integration with automatic synchronization
 * Detailed storage tracking per host and tenant
 .
 This package provides the core FileEngine server and client tools.
